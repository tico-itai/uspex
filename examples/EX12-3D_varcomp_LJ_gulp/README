Since 9.3.8, we slightly change the definition of Lattice values
in the INPUT.txt for variable composition. Instead of the atomic
volume, the estimated volume for each block is now required.

For instance, suppose the two blocks are Ar and Kr.
One should put the volumes for single Ar and Kr atom.
% atomType
Mo B
% EndAtomType

% numSpecies
1 0
0 1
% EndNumSpecies

% Latticevalues (this word MUST stay here, type values below)
16.5 6.2
% Endvalues (this word MUST stay here)


If the blocks are MoB and B.
One should put the volumes for MoB and B.

% numSpecies
1 1
0 1
% EndNumSpecies

% Latticevalues (this word MUST stay here, type values below)
22.7 6.2
% Endvalues (this word MUST stay here)

The setup is trivial. USPEX makes it even simpler by having a powerful algorithm to estimate the volumes by default.
Also, results1/approximate_volumes give the reference values as well.

approximate volume for each species:
19.0329 7.7325
